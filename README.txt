You will need to reconstruct the file "14.tot_dat" using TestDataReconstruction if you want to use that
data in the network.
This is due to GH's 100Mb file size limit - I've broken the file up into small chunks that can be
glued back together to form the final file. It'll take a while, but it's 2M+ 9D data points and I don't want to host it somewhere.
